This is the Courseworks for F29DC Data Communications and Networking, 3rd year of BSc Computer Science.
This coursework is about analysing the 7 labs we had throughout the semester, and to create different network topologies. NS2 has been used to develop the networks. 
To analyse my networks I also created a text parser to extract important information from a trace file to a .CSV file. This parser is written in Java. 

The source code for this program has been encrypted due to the coursework being still used. Everything can be found in F29DC-CW_with_all_labs-networks_in_TCL.zip

If you want to have a look at the code, password can be requested fromÂ wrt_95@hotmail.com.
